Steps setting up the environment: 

1. `vagrant up` (ensure envvar `VAGRANT_EXPERIMENTAL` includes "disks")

2. `vagrant ssh` -- this will defaults ssh to the master vm

3. (inside master) `sudo -i`

4. (inside master) `cd /opt/ceph-ansible && ansible-playbook site.yml`

5. (inside master) if stuck at "waiting for all osds to be up", ctrl-C to cancel 
the deployment and ssh into each worker, run: `ceph-volume lvm create --data /dev/sdX`,
where X is the unformatted, secondary disk.
(If error occurs when creating LVM OSD, run `ceph-volume lvm zap /dev/sdX --destroy` to
uninitialize the disk and run the aforementioned OSD create command again.
NO NEED TO RESTART ANSIBLE DEPLOYMENT.)

6. (inside master) rerun 4 and everything should be fine

7. after installation, edit hosts on master and avoid resolving to 127.0.1.1 for 
Prometheus metric collection
